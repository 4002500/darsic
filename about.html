<p>        Darussalam Iraqi Canadian Association (DARSIC) is a non-political, non-profit and social organization that represent and provide assistance to the people having Iraqi and neighboring countries origin who have their descendants reside in Canada. It promotes, safeguards and preserves the cultural education, economic, social and other interests, their rights and core values of Iraq and neighboring countries. DICA helps newly arrived Iraqis, especially the refugee families for their various settlement related issues, such as education, employment, housing, immigration and so on.
</p>
<p>
  The Iraqi community in Ottawa came together in 2010 to create an organization to help new immigrants and to conserve Iraqi cultures and values and the Arabic language. The organization was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 2011. Provide Fee settlement service to the new Iraqi families and individuals in Canada. We have citizenship preparation courses, swimming courses, outdoor sports activities such as Soccer, football, and Arabic language classes and so on. Darussalam succeeded in making the Iraqi community in Canada converge with each other. Through this rapport, the organization has arranged many weddings and helped people get married. Darussalam now has members in many different cities such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Mississauga, Toronto, Windsor, Montreal, and Edmonton. We have different activities in these cities. The organization is expanding year after year and is welcoming new members.

</p>
<p>The Darussalam Iraqi Canadian Association has been involved with helping the new settlers to Canada in many ways. The Darussalam Iraqi Canadian Association completed the filing for more than twenty Iraqi families sponsorships through this agreement and are awaiting the families arrival. Darussalam has already welcomed the first applicant and helped him find work in the medical field.
</p>
<p>The Darussalam Iraqi Canadian Association has long been working to settle new immigrants and refugees into Canada by providing them guidance, financial help, education, and community services to ease the transition period for the newcomers. Darussalam has a storage facility to collect furniture, clothes, and other necessities for the newcomers who need it.
</p>
<p>
  Through Darussalam resources, which include the wide range of volunteers and good relationship with many other charitable and non-profit organizations, we were able to help in providing shelter, clothing, furniture, health services, education, and so many other resources to refugees, immigrants, and newcomers to Canada.

</p>
<p>
So far, our organization helped and provided settlement related services to more than 30 families. We celebrate two religious holidays of Muslim and Christians, such as Eid (Al-fitar and Al-dhoha) and Christmas every year. To mark those occasions, we arrange/organize gatherings and parties, exchange of pleasantries and greeting to each other, have food and chat together, which increases the social harmony bondage among the community members.
